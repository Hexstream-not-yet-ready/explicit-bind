UNSUPPORTED. UNSTABLE? INCOMPLETE? explicit-bind is a Common Lisp
library that effectively enables intermixing of any number of LET,
LET*, (an enhanced version of) FLET, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND and
DESTRUCTURING-BIND constructs, at the cost of only one level of
indentation.

This solves the problem of too many levels of indentation introduced
by nested binding constructs, which is a recurring one in complex (and
even not-so-complex) code.

Unlike apparently similar constructs, explicit-bind retains sanity,
low cognitive load and intuitiveness by not overemphasizing
conciseness and "cleverness".

It also makes usage of multiple values and local functions much more
natural, convenient and rewarding.

It also allows more precise placement of declarations where they
belong, and IGNORE, IGNORABLE and SPECIAL declarations can be placed
"inline" with the bound names, eliminating aggravating duplication
inherent in the traditional approach.

Load it with ASDF: (asdf:load-system '#:explicit-bind).
(Make sure ASDF can find explicit-bind.asd beforehand.)
